Marking highlight 1
Place the cursor under the first character of the text concerned and press
HIGHLIGHT 1. The text will move to the right and underbar will appear.

Move  the  cursor  to  the  space  after  the  last  character of the text
concerned and press HIGHLIGHT 1 again.  A second underbar will  appear and
if  there  is any text to the right it will move  to  make  room  for  the
underbar.

When printed the  text  between  the  underbars will be in the highlight 1
mode, i.e. unless the effect has been  changed  with  the  HT,  it will be
underlined.

Marking highlight 2
Follow  the same procedure as for highlight 1.  Instead of an underbar the
marker in  the  text is an asterisk.  In the default mode this will result
in bold type.
