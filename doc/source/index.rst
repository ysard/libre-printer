Overview of Libre-Printer |release|
===================================

|project_name| is a free reimplementation of the Retroprinter project and its
proprietary interface.
The idea is to provide a software and hardware interface masquerading as a printer
that is compatible with older medical and industrial devices (machine tools).

Sometimes these devices cannot be replaced for cost reasons or simply because
there is no justification to do so.
However, they often work in pairs with printers that are no longer manufactured
and are often the weak point of the installation because they are prone to
breakdowns and the abandonment of the manufacture of their consumables.
