Overview of Libre-Printer |release|
===================================

Libre Printer is a free reimplementation of the Retroprinter project and its proprietary interface.
The idea is to provide a software and hardware interface masquerading as a printer that is compatible
with older medical and industrial devices (machine tools).

Sometimes these devices cannot be replaced for cost reasons or simply because there is no justification to do so.
However, they often work in pairs with printers that are no longer manufactured and are often the weak point of
the installation because they are prone to breakdowns and the abandonment of the manufacture of their consumables.
