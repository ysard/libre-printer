Commercial
==========

This is to limit the uses integrated in proprietary devices whose vendors would
not participate in the project in a fair way and who would otherwise be guilty
of any violation of the |project_name| license as well as of the free software
used by |project_name| itself.

With such a license you maintain full ownership and control over your products,
while allowing you to distribute your products to customers as you wish.
You are not obligated to share your proprietary source code and this saves you
from having to conform to the requirements and restrictions of the AGPL.
